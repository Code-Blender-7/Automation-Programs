### About the Program

The Twitter Auto Login is a Python Automatic Bot that is made out of selenium. This Bot was live tested and posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Black_2_white/status/1368723215367905284)

The program takes 3 values. A password and a username for the user and then it requires a 3rd value which is our tweet message.

<h2><b>*** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***</b></h2>
Please download the latest version of your webdriver from time to time. Selenium needs update-to-date webdriver to work. If your webdriver version doesn't match your browser version, the program will fail.

## Additional Notice,
<b>This project is still under built so expect a bug. Also note that interacting with the automated software can lead this program to crash!.</b>
